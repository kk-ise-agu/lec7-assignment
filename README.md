# Exercise 7: Plotting data in Python (10 points)

This week we'll put together our data analysis and plotting skills using Pandas and Matplotlib to create visualizations.

If you are uncertain about **the style of your code**, take a look at the **[PEP 8 - Style guide for Python code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)**.

After making your changes to the notebook, you will need to upload it to GitHub.

- **Exercise 7 is due by 17:00 on Friday, 23 October 2020)**.
- Don't forget to check out the [hints for this week's exercise](https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L7/exercise-7.html#exercise-7-hints) if you're having trouble.

## Before you start

### Clone the Exercise 7 repository

- Make sure you cloned your own repository (repository name contains your GitHub username). 
- After solving the problems, remember to commit your changes and push them to GitHub. 
- Remember also to answer all written questions in the exercise, in addition to the programming tasks.

## Getting started

Always remove these two lines when starting to work on an exercise:
```
# REPLACE THE ERROR BELOW WITH YOUR OWN CODE
raise NotImplementedError()
```
This error will tell us if you have not even started to solve the problem when checking the exercises :)

## Problems

Exercise 7 has 2 problems worth 10 points in total. 

 - [Problem 1: Random scatter plot (3 points)](Exercise-7-problem-1.ipynb)
 - [Problem 2: Plotting temperatures (7 points)](Exercise-7-problem-2.ipynb)
